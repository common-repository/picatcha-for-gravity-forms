This plugin adds the ease of use and security of Picatcha's Pix-Captcha to your Gravity Forms in WordPress. Why settle for a difficult to use text CAPTCHAs when you have already invested so much in a fantastic form system?

== Description == 
This plugin require the Gravity Forms Plugin. Don't have Gravity forms? You can purchase it at www.gravityforms.com.

### Add usable CAPTCHAs to your Forms

Pix-Captcha is a unique image-identification CAPTCHA that effectively protects your website from Internet abuseâ€“ in this case, your Gravity Forms from spam submissions. If you have already used the built in text CAPTCHA of Gravity Forms, you know that reading the text and figuring out the cryptic words can be quite difficult. Pix-Captcha replaces the existing CAPTCHA with easy to recognize images. Image recognition is easy for humans, but still quite difficult for computers, making submitting forms easy and secure. 

Check out www.picatcha.com to get a set of keys, and try it out on your Gravity Forms today!

Features:
* Add Pix-Captcha to any and all of your forms.
* Customize Pix-Captcha per form.
* Customizations include: grid layout, image size, theme color, image noise level and type, and the option to display our logo.

If you already have the Picatcha plugin for WordPress, you can reuse the keys for this plugin too.

Known Issues:
* Currently, there is a slight incompatibility with the Picatcha Plugin for WordPress. If you enable PixCaptcha for Gravity Forms, then enable Picatcha for WordPress, there is a conflict with a common library. The PixCaptcha for Gravity Forms picatchalib has been patched. If you enable Picatcha for WordPress _then_ enable Pix-Captcha for Gravity forms, it will work. This should only affect Picatcha for WordPress versions 1.3 and earlier.
* Displaying two forms (with Pix-Captcha in both) on the same page will cause only one Pix-Captcha to render. We're looking into this. The Regular text CAPTCHA does this too.
